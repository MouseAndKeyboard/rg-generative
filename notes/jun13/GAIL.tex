\section{Goal}

Imitation Learning is the name of the game. The end goal of GAIL is to have a way to produce a policy \(\pi_{\theta}\) which tries to copy another policy \(\pi_{E}\) by observing samples of this policy.

E.g. behaviours which are hard to assign a reward to.

\section{High Level}

We have a discriminator which attempts to determine if a series of trajectories comes from the optimal policy \(\pi_{E}\) or from some other policy \(\pi_{\theta}\).

Once the discriminator is no longer able to distinguish the trajectories we've likely got a very similar policy.

The discriminator's confidence is used as a cost function to update the parameters \(\theta\).

\section{Other approaches}

\subsection{Behavioural Cloning (BC)}

We treat the problem as a supervised learning problem.
We want a way to predict the action \(\pi*\) would take given an observation.

\begin{center}
  \textbf{Covariate Shift:} The agent enters states which it was not exposed to during training. E.g. Car driving off the road.
\end{center}

Because of slight inaccuracies In BC, the policy will likey find itself in a novel state (covariate shift), it would be highly unclear what the agent might do (since it's just supervised learning). This can lead it to getting more off-course and into even more novel states. This is called compounding (or cascading) error.

This is because BC learns to fit single-timestep decisions as opposed to fitting to the behaviour of \(\pi_{E}\) on the whole trajectory.

\section{Inverse Reinforcement Learning}
Produce a reward function which best explains the actions taken by an agent.

The paper uses 'Maximum Causal Entropy IRL'. Intuitively, it will find a cost function \(c \in C\) which gives a low cost to the expert policy and a high cost to all other policies. After finding the cost function we can train an RL agent on it.

\[\max_{c \in C}\left( \min_{\pi \in \Pi} - H(\pi) + E_{\pi}[c(s,a)] \right) -E_{\pi_{E}}[c(s,a)] \]

(Not quite sure \emph{why} the entropy term is in there) I'll probably need to read the maximum causal entropy IRL paper to fully understand its purpose.

Once we have this cost function which maximises this difference between all \(\pi\) and \(\pi_{E}\) we can just do RL to find a good policy.

\subsection{Selecting C}

The largest set of possible cost function \( \Re^{S \times A} = \{c : S \times A \to \Re\} \).
In order to prevent the cost function overfitting to our finite dataset it we need to add a convex function regularizer \(\psi\).

The IRL procedure which finds a cost function such that the expert outperforms all other policies is now:

\[IRL_{\psi}(\pi_{E}) = {c \in \Re^{S \times A}} - \psi(c) + (\min_{\pi \in \Pi} - H(\pi) + E_{\pi}[c(s,a)]) - E_{\pi_{E}}[c(s,a)]\]

\[\tilde{c} \in IRL_{\psi}(\pi_{E})\]

we want \(RL(\tilde{c})\)

\subsection{Occupancy Measure Matching}
The occupancy measure \(\rho_\pi\) measures the distribution of state-action pairs that an agent encounters when navigating the environment.
Since a policy uniquely defines an occupancy measure and a valid \footnote{Positive probabilities + some more constraints} occupancy measure uniquely defines a policy

With this fact, they show:

\[RL(IRL_{\psi}(\pi_{E})) = argmin_{\pi \in \Pi} -H(\pi) + \psi^{*}(\rho_{\pi} - \rho_{pi_{E}})\]

Why's this important? Because it shows that the IRL procedure tries to minimise the distance between the expert's occupancy measure and the new policy as measured by the convex function \(\psi^{*}\).

They come up with two conclusions:
IRL is a dual of an occupancy measure matching problem. I \emph{think} this means that occupancy matching and IRL complete the same outcome.

\textbf{The induced optimal policy is the 'primal optimum'} Again, I don't know what a primal optimum is but they basically say that: IRL usually is thought of as the process of finding a cost function which explains the expert policy however it can alternatively be seen as a procedure which tries to induce a policy that matches the expert's occupancy measure.
