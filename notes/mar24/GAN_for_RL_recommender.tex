    \section{Setting}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You work at YouTube and want to recommend YouTube videos to your users to maximise their "utility" from watching videos.
        \item You have access to a set of available videos (all YouTube videos) to show the user.
        \item You must design an algorithm to select videos to present users after they watch a video.
        \item You have access to users' historical view data.
        \item Once shown a selection of recommendations, the user may click on one of the videos to watch or may abstain from clicking.
    \end{itemize}
