    \subsection{Problem}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Normal reinforcement learning is the process of extracting an optimal policy for a given reward function in an environment.
        \item Inverse reinforcement learning is the process of extracting a reward function from an environment given observed optimal behavior.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{Example}
    You are able to observe an agent as it tackles the Mountain Car problem:
